htmlDependency(name, version, src, meta = NULL, script = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Library name}

\item{version}{Library version}

\item{src}{Unnamed single-element character vector indicating the full path
of the library directory. Alternatively, a named character string with one
or more elements, indicating different places to find the library; see
Details.}

\item{meta}{Named list of meta tags to insert into document head}

\item{script}{Script(s) to include within the document head (should be
specified relative to the \code{path} parameter).}

\item{stylesheet}{Stylesheet(s) to include within the document (should be
specified relative to the \code{path} parameter).}

\item{head}{Arbitrary lines of HTML to insert into the document head}

\item{attachment}{Attachment(s) to include within the document head. See
  Details.}
}
\value{
An object that can be included in a list of dependencies passed to
  \code{\link{attachDependencies}}.

\description{
Define an HTML dependency (i.e. CSS and/or JavaScript bundled in a
directory). HTML dependencies make it possible to use libraries like jQuery,
Bootstrap, and d3 in a more composable and portable way than simply using
script, link, and style tags.
}
\details{
Each dependency can be located on the filesystem, at a relative or
  absolute URL, or both. The location types are indicated using the names of
  the \code{src} character vector: \code{file} for filesystem directory,
  \code{href} for URL. For example, a dependency that was both on disk and
  at a URL might use \code{src = c(file=filepath, href=url)}.

  \code{attachment} can be used to make the indicated files available to the
  JavaScript on the page via URL. For each element of \code{attachment}, an
  element \code{<link id="DEPNAME-ATTACHINDEX-attachment" rel="attachment"
  href="...">} is inserted, where \code{DEPNAME} is \code{name}. The value of
  \code{ATTACHINDEX} depends on whether \code{attachment} is named or not; if
  so, then it's the name of the element, and if not, it's the 1-based index
  of the element. JavaScript can retrieve the URL using something like
  \code{document.getElementById(depname + "-" + index + "-attachment").href}.
  Note that depending on the rendering context, the runtime value of the
  href may be an absolute, relative, or data URI.

Use \code{\link{attachDependencies}} to associate a list of
  dependencies with the HTML it belongs with.
